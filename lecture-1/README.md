# Summary

Learning Programming is just like learning any kind of language, like English. It has rules and syntax.
We use alphabets, numbers and special symbols in writing programs unlike english where you only use alphabets.
Programs consist of variable names, functions, operators etc.

## Variables
A variable is a name or placeholder in your RAM/ memory that stores a value.

Variable naming follow some basic rules
A good variable name must be explanatory.
A variable name must not start with a number.
It can start with an alphabet.
It must have no space. You can use an underscore to make it more readable.
When you introduce an underscore in variable naming it is termed as snake case. You can also have camel case to make it readable. ie. firstName.
We use all caps for constants. Ie PI = 3.142

# Data types. 
1. Primitive data types
2. Complex 

Primitive data types are integers, decimals, boolean, etc.

Complex data types are set, list, classes, tuples, dictionaries, etc

## Diff between set and list
- Set does not accept duplicates whiles list accepts duplicates
- Set has an add method for add items unto the set
- List has append for appending items unto the list.

# Operators 

+, -, %, *, /
`** - exponent`
`% - remainder`




# Functions
Function declaration or definition must start with 
def, Followed by the function name, a parenthesis and `:` and can have a return statement.

ie.

```
def sum(a, b):
  return a +b;
```
